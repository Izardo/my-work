# This program will use various variable types for practice 
# Author: Isabella Doyle

# the following variable is a integer type
intNum = 123

# the following variable is a float type
floatingNum = 1.23

# the following variable is a boolean type
boolType = True
secondBool = False

# the following variable is a string type
firstString = 'I am a string.'

# the following variable is a list type
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# printing the type of variable using the type function
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('intNum', type(intNum), intNum))
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('floatingNum', type(floatingNum), floatingNum))
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('boolType', type(boolType), boolType))
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('secondBool', type(secondBool), secondBool))
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('firstString', type(firstString), firstString))
print('Variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('myList', type(myList), myList))
